# Improvements

I have started to change the structure of my website, opting for a simpler layout. In December, I managed to finish only the login system, but not at all the routes for the challenges. I then decided to begin creating the routes to retrieve, create, delete, publish, etc., the challenges.

I was also able to integrate the Unsplash API into my site.

Other elements I have been able to add:

* Displaying errors on the canvas rather than as alerts.

* Allowing users to play a challenge and writing an answer and then saying if it is the good one or if it is false.

* Permitting users to delete only their own challenges, not those created by other users.

* Successfully hosting both my backend and frontend.

My project is much more comprehensive now, and it fulfills the requirements for the project.
